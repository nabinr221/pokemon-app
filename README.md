## Project Setup

### Clone the project

```
git clone https://github.com/nabinr221/pokemon-app.git

cd pokemon-app
```

### Install dependancy and run projects

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Tech stack

- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- Lucide-React: A collection of beautifully simple, customizable SVG icons for React.
- Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the Pokemon API.

## Features

- View a list of Pokemon with their names, images, and types
- Search by name (provide the name of a Pokemon and click the search icon)
- Data is cached for performance
- SEO friendly

## Components

- Navbar: A responsive navigation bar with logo (project name).
- InputField: A reusable input component for the search functionality.
- PokemonCard: A component that displays individual Pokemon Information.
- PokemonList: The main component that fetches and displays the list of Pokemon

## How It Works

- Fetching Data: The app uses Axios to fetch data from the Pokemon API. The fetchWithCache utility function caches the data to improve performance.
- Displaying Data: Pokemon data is displayed in a grid layout using the PokemonCard component for each Pokemon.
- Searching: Users can search for Pokemon by name. The search functionality is implemented to filter the Pokemon list based on the user input.
